### Task

Connect Web Development with different people in the world, not only knowing english as I am Guatemalan. So that everyone can connect.

### Solution

The chat was created with the import and use of Google Translate API, in which handles the translation of the whole website, chat, that the people are using. Also, emojis are available to the public and can be used for showing emotions in the chat. Connecting cultures.
