### Task

To create a simulation of a kernel or terminal form Mac OS/Linux.

### Solution

The project involves python programming language in which can have standard input and command line version, to simulate a real kernel and its functionalities. This was oriented to the Operating Systems creation, which I am really interested into. This project was a success, but still can make it better with some tweaks.
